When disaster strikes, emergency responders are flooded with calls, but how do they know which areas need help first?
I'm presenting Sentinel AI – an AI-assisted emergency intake platform that helps responders prioritize and visualize disaster requests in real time.
During floods, earthquakes, or wildfires, emergency teams struggle with unorganized data; calls come fast and there is no clear way to see which locations are critical, where the injuries are, or what resources are needed most urgently.
This delays response times, and in disasters, delays cost lives.
Sentinel AI solves this: it is a zero-setup web platform where victims or volunteers submit emergency requests through a simple form.
Our system instantly calculates a priority score based on urgency, injury severity, and resource needs, then plots each incident on a live interactive map with color-coded markers: red for critical, yellow for moderate, green for low urgency.
Let me show you how it works: here is our emergency intake form; I will submit a request from Pokhara Lakeside, Nepal.
Notice how the form captures all essential details – name, location, emergency type, urgency level, injury status, and resources needed.
The moment I hit submit, our AI scoring engine processes the submission and returns a priority score; this incident scores 89 out of 100 – high priority.
Now it appears on our live map as a red marker indicating critical urgency.
When I click the marker, we see all the details – reporter name, contact, emergency type, urgency level, and resources needed.
Let me add another request from Los Angeles with lower urgency; notice how this one appears as a green marker – the system automatically color-codes based on priority.
The incident counter updates in real time so responders can see the total number of active incidents at a glance.
Here is what powers Sentinel AI: the frontend is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – zero build steps, fully static, works anywhere.
For the map, we use Leaflet with CARTO Voyager tiles for clear, English-labeled visuals.
The backend is a lightweight FastAPI service using geopy and Nominatim for accurate geocoding; if the backend goes down, a deterministic client-side fallback keeps the demo running offline.
It is resilient by design.
This platform is built for disaster response teams, NGOs, local authorities, and volunteers.
Imagine a flood in Kathmandu: instead of sifting through hundreds of calls, responders open Sentinel AI and instantly see where the critical cases are; they dispatch resources faster, prioritize the injured, and save more lives.
What makes Sentinel AI different?
One – it is a zero-config solution; no complex setup, just open the browser and start.
Two – it is resilient; even without the backend, the platform keeps working with a client-side fallback.
Three – it is real-time; every submission updates the map instantly, giving responders a live operational picture.
Four – it is mobile-friendly; victims can submit requests from their phones in the middle of a crisis.
Looking ahead, we plan to integrate real-time SMS alerts for responders, add multi-language support for global use, and connect with drone footage for live disaster zone monitoring.
We are also exploring AI-powered clustering to identify the hardest-hit areas automatically.
Sentinel AI is not just a hackathon project; it is a tool that could save lives.
When every second matters, we make sure help gets to the right place at the right time.
Thank you.
